## Background
During the second half of the year 2007, The Philippine Science High School Batch of 1982 spearheaded the organization of the Dr. Cleofe M. Bacuñgan Natatanging Guro Endowment Fund Project. From an original Batch Project, they invited the PSHS Alumni Association, PSHS Foundation, Inc. and the PSHS System Administration officials to join hands in establishing the Project.

The Project’s goal is to help maintain high teaching excellence in Science, Mathematics and Humanities on the secondary education level.  The target endowment fund to be raised for the first year is Five Million Pesos [P5,000,000.00], reaching up to One Hundred Million Pesos [P100,000,000.00] in the next three [3] to five [5] years. Income from the funds will provide for the financial incentives and programs to recruit, retain, and help further improve the level of teaching competence in the PSHS System.

## Vision/Mission

* To make the PSHS System the teaching destination of choice of the country’s best secondary school teachers in the field of Science, Mathematics and Humanities.
* To achieve teaching excellence and effectiveness that will be supported by programs to recruit, develop and retain highly qualified education.
